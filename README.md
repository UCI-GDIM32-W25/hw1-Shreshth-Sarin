I added the Player bunny sprite and implemented the WASD move actions in Update() inside Player.cs. This update function also checks for the Space Key pressed down to plant the seed. When the space key is pressed down, the player will plant a single plant at its current position. 

This is done by calling the PlantSeed() function in Player.cs. This function also handles in the incremation of Seeds Planted text UI and decrementation of Seeds Left text UI. There is an if statement to check if the number is 0 or not. Only one _plantPrefab is Instantiated at the Player's position.

To change the text UI, the PlantSeed() function calls the UpdateSeeds(int seedsLeft, int seedsPlanted) function in PlantCountUI.cs. This function is called twice in Player.cs - 
    1. In Start() to display the original number count.
    2. In PlantSeed() which is called in Update(). This ensures the changes in the numbers after every seed planted.
